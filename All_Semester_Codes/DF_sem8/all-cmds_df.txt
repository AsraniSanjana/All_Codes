MountPoints2 → This key will record which user was logged into Windows
when a specific USB device was connected
1. USB Device History in Windows Registry:
● HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR:
This registry key contains information about USB storage devices previously
connected to the system. It includes details such as the vendor ID, product
ID, device serial number, and timestamps of device connections. The
presence of each entry in this key indicates a unique USB storage device that
has been plugged into the system.
● HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices: The
MountedDevices subkey stores drive letter allocations, which map USB
device serial numbers to specific drive letters or volumes that were mounted
during device insertion. This mapping provides insights into the drive letters
assigned to USB devices and their corresponding serial numbers.
● HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Expl
orer\MountPoints2: This registry key records user accounts associated with
connected USB devices. It contains information about which user was
logged into Windows when a specific USB device was connected, along
with timestamps indicating the last write time for each device entry.
● HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Usb: This
registry key holds technical information about connected USB devices,
including hardware details and timestamps of device connections. It
provides additional insights into the configuration and characteristics of
USB devices connected to the system
